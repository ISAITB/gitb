    shortDescription: Web application for the conformance testing of IT systems
      against semantic and technical specifications.
    longDescription: >-
      The Interoperability Test Bed is a service offered by the European
      Commission’s DIGIT to facilitate the conformance testing of IT systems.
      The Test Bed is itself a software system that can be both downloaded and
      installed locally, but also reused through a shared online installation
      operated by DIGIT. It offers an intuitive web user interface and rich
      integration features that allow administrators to define their project’s
      overall testing setup as well as users to connect and run tests.

      In terms of the testing approach it follows, the Test Bed is typically
      used to exchange messages with the software systems being tested,
      supporting both the sending and receiving of messages, validating all
      steps against the target specification and according to the specific
      scenario’s expectations. Such scenarios can focus on technical details but
      can also be defined at business-level, exposing details only when needed
      to troubleshoot failures. Furthermore, tests can be designed to cover both
      normal flows but also edge cases and error scenarios that would be
      otherwise difficult to replicate.
